// Inheritance is a super class that extended to smaller pieces that add or overwrite functionalities
// Composition is smaller peices to create something bigger
// Tight coupling problemt -> Fragile base class problem
// Heirarchy problem
// The subclass will have no choice but to inherit the characteristics of the main class


//Programming paradigms
// Same goals

// ->OOP
// Organizing the code into units would be called object oriented programming
// An object is a box containing information and operations that are supposed to refer the same concept
// pilars -> abstraction -> encapsulation -> inheritance -> polymorpism
// common C-sharp, Python, Java
// Few operations on common data
//stateful



// -> FP
// Avoiding side effects and writing pure functions is called Functional programming
// Code is essentially a combination of functions and data is immuateble which leads to writing programs with no side effects
// function cannot change the outside world ad the output value of a function simply depends on the given arguments
// Idea pure functions and composition
// common in closure in Haskell
// Many operations on fixed data
// stateless
